<!-- Inspired by a scene from Call of Duty: Advanced warefare this is my attemp to recreate a login panel the player uses towards the middle of the game. The entire design concept as well as behaviors come from the game, I just tried to implement them via the web. Give it a couple of tries and when you've had enough.-->

      <p>I took some shortcuts with error cases, transition events, and backbone in general  but overall it should work well enough as a password form. Hope you liked it and a thanks to the baller designers at Sledgehammer for coming up with this terminal concept. Hit that button if you wanna play with the terminal some more. Cheers =)</p>
